This site hosts the code examples I use in the University of Michigan's AEROSP 523 CFD course.

## Acknowledgements

Several of the examples on this site are inspired by code originally written by Prof [Krzysztof Fidkowski](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kfid/), and were adapted in many cases to use JAX with the help of Prof [Venkat Viswanathan](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/viswanathan-venkat/).
Several of the figures used in the examples are taken from Professor Fidkowski's excellent CFD course notes.
